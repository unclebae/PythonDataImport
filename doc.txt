I Know I'll Always Love You

They said she was on drugs and I was only a child;
They said 'go on with my life, have fun for a while'...
But what they didn't understand is where their hearts wouldn't go
Is the love that existed, and what I did know...
So I looked all over for her, but she couldn't be found;
Family and friends hadn't seen her around...
I stopped at corner stores hoping someone knew
Where she had been, or what I could do...
The many places she's been laying her head
Seemed to be the homes of the walking dead...
But what the dead needed, we could surely show;
Is the love that existed, and I already did know...
But finally in an old abandoned house
I knocked on the door and she came out...
I didn't notice anything, except her eyes;
They told me she loved me and she was happily surprised.
I held her close and cried in her chest;
Of all the hugs I'd gotten, hers were the best...
She sat down, and I gave her the gift I wrapped with care
And told how I'd been out looking for her everywhere...
I sang her happy birthday, and then I had to go;
I'll always love you, she said, and I replied, I know...
